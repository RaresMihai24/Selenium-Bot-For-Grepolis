# Selenium-Bot-For-Grepolis

This is a bot made in ~ 2 hours when I wanted to learn selenium.
The bot essentially makes accounts on a tor puppet browser and then activates vacantion mode on each account.

Functionalities:
- creates endless accounts, the program doesn't stop
- saves said accounts on two text files, one with the ones that failed due to captcha and one with all the accounts
- enters every succesfull account and builds one level of the senat and then activates vacantion mode
- reloads tor when "Error connecting to the server" appears > 10 times
- no errors in the console anymore, all errors are saved in a file "error_log.txt"
- has a fancy output in console

DISCLAIMER: 
This bot was made on and for Grepolis Romania and in their ToS isn't stipulated at this time (september 2023) that it's illegal to create such bot, only using it.
Therefore I don't encourage anyone to use this bot to harm any server. It was created only with the solely tought of learning selenium.
